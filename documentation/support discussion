Description	Hi, 
I am trying to enable the Dependency approach with the web sample. Unfortunately, the server does not reply with neither Dependency nor DependencyValue in the metadata. 




Please advice,

Hello, 

Here is some feedback from development: 

> [metadataXmlStr] => 0 0 0 

Most likely the correct XML string comes in metadataXmlStr, and "0 0 0" is the way the XML is displayed by browser. Can you please click the 'View page source' context menu item in browser and check what is in the HTML code of that page? If there is still no XML inside the HTML could you save the HTML and send it to us? 

One more test to do: 

setup the sources from the attached metadata.zip archive on your web server in the similar way you would install our PHP sample, if needed adjust manually index.php to provide correct IP, port, user name and password to connect to Switch and then open the url "http://127.0.0.1/metadata/" in local browser. You should see the XML content like on the attached screenshot. This screenshot we created using your flow. In our case the XML is displayed. 
Let us know if you can see the XML. 

Also let us know the exact Switch version you use.

Hi,

in order to remove all doubts about unicode issues I create a simple flow (attached) with short field names with the same result (see below)




Please help us urgently!!!




witchclient\SubmitPointData Object ( [name] => Dependency Check [displayName] => Dependency Check (C-Copy Automation), DependencyCheck [displayThumbnailBase64] => [metadataXmlStr] => 0 0 0 [metadata] => Array ( [0] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => a [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => number [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => 0 ) [1] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => a1 [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => number [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => 0 ) [2] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => a2 [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => number [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => 0 ) [3] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => a3 [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => string [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => ) [4] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => b [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => string [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => ) [5] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => b1 [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => string [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => ) [6] => switchclient\MetadataToFillClass Object ( [mtfLabel] => b2 [mtfDescription] => [mtfDataType] => string [mtfDataFormat] => [mtfValueIsRequired] => [mtfRememberLastValue] => [mtfValue] => ) ) )

Hello, 

Please also send us your latest flow version so that we can do test locally.

Hello, 

Feedback from development: 

The XML file that represents metadata is serialized into a unicode string representation and included into SOAP packet that itself is the XML that is then serialized into a byte stream using UTF-8 and then sent via HTTP to Client. So on the Client side the incoming byte stream has to be decoded from UTF-8 encoding and then the value of the tag <metadataXmlStr> shall be a unicode string representation of a valid XML. 

For example, if I define a metadata tag with the name "Ḋ" (Ḋ - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH DOT ABOVE with Unicode code 0x1E0A and UTF-8 representation: e1b8 8a) then the SOAP packet sent by Server over HTTP to Client looks the like the following: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" 
xmlns:SOAP-ENC="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
xmlns:butterfly="http://tempuri.org/butterfly.xsd"><SOAP-ENV:Body><butterfly:GetSubmitPointNameResponse><submitPointData><name>Submit 
point 1</name><displayName>Submit point 1 (Test Server), New 
flow</displayName><displayThumbnailBase64></displayThumbnailBase64><metadataXmlStr>&lt;ValueDescription 
Type="metadatafields"&gt;&#xA; &lt;spMF_1 Format="" LocalizedTagName="Ḋ" 
Subtype="inline" Tooltip="" Type="string" ReadOnly="No" ValueIsRequired="No" 
Editor="inline" FormatEditor="inline" DisplayField="Yes" 
RememberLastValue="No"&gt;&lt;/spMF_1&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ValueDescription&gt;&#xA;</metadataXmlStr><metadata><mtfLabel>Ḋ</mtfLabel><mtfDescription></mtfDescription><mtfDataType>string</mtfDataType><mtfDataFormat></mtfDataFormat><mtfValueIsRequired>false</mtfValueIsRequired><mtfRememberLastValue>false</mtfRememberLastValue><mtfValue></mtfValue></metadata></submitPointData></butterfly:GetSubmitPointNameResponse></SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope> 

The content of the <metadataXmlStr> is what you would need. The Ḋ is encoded by UTF-8 using bytes e1 b8 8a. Excatly the same byte string should arrive on Client side and appropriately decoded then. 

I suggest that you try the following: 
1) in Switch flow defines a submit point with single metadata field with only 1 latin character and checks if he gets correct metadataXmlStr on Client side. 
This should work well because there are other customers who are using SDK and they use this feature 
2) if above works then replaces the latin character with single Ḋ character and try again 
3) if above works extends the metadata fields structure till the point it stops working 

Let us know the results of the tests above. We will then decide what the next step would be. 

We will continue our research in the meantime as well.

Fyi - the stars "*" are part of one field so they are not related to the serialization problem

Hello,

Thank you for your reply,

What kind of serialization do you use?

We have tried to decode the string received but no luck.

The string in metadataXmlStr returns with UTF-8 chars and a long string of
* in the middle.

If the * is the serialized data, although i doubt it, then we are unable to
de-serialize it and will appreciate a sample code to achieve it.

Best Regards.

בברכה,
שלומי קורן.

Hello, 

More feedback from development: 

The metadataXmlStr is a serialized xml. This is a Unicode string so to decode it the customer should use the correct codec (UTF-16 or UTF-8). We would like to suggest to define a metadata containing only ASCII characters and checks if this can decode the arrived metadataXmlStr. 

Also note that our PHP sample does not correctly handle Unicode characters in metadataXmlStr. This is the limitation logged here (24768 - Encoding issues in PHP sample in SwitchClient SDK). 
So you are using our PHP sample as a base for your solution, it may not work. You will have to change it yourself to correctly work with Unicode. 

Do let us know if still having additional questions.

Hello,

We have looked at section '6.3 Switch metadata format' in the
documentation, and it does not match the metadata we get.

The content of the metadataXmlStr field we get is :

[metadataXmlStr] => בפנים לא 1 חד צדדי CMYK 0 0 0 0 נ"ע 80 גרם כרטיס
ביקור ללא סיכות אמצע צר*****************************************************
****************************************************** No No No No No No 50

It does not contain the attributes in the documentation and specificly
the Dependency and Dependencyvalue attributes.

Please advice on how to get the relevant metadata.

Best Regards.

Hello, 

Here is feedback from development: 

The dependent metadata is the feature appeared in Switch 10 so for compatibility reasons it is available only in the extra field metadataXmlStr. This is the serialized XML representing the metadata in a new format. There Dependency and DependencyValue are defined. The description of this format can be found in '6.3 Switch metadata format' section of Web Services Module Documentation. 

Can you please check that part in the documentation and do not hesitate to contact us if still having any questions.

Hello, 

If it is not returning a value then please send us the flow and screenshots of the problem so that we can assist further.

this I knew:)

There are dependencies defined of course. I will do a re-check but I am quite sure that it is not returning the values!!!

Hello, 

Sorry for the delay, here is feedback from development: 

The Dependency and DependencyValue in the metadata appear when there are dependent properties defined in Submit point or Checkpoint metadata property in a flow. 

See also the chapter 'Defining metadata fields' on page 322 in Switch reference documenation for more info.

Hi, 
I understand that development is investigating the issue. I only want to stress the urgency, as I purchased the web services as a replacement for switch client (5 licenses are not enough for me). 

Thank you For your understanding 

Ariel
